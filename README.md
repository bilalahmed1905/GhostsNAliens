# GhostsNAliens
A game I made using TypeScript and JavaScript

The game has 3 levels. Your objective is to survive and defeat all of the aliens.

You have two weapons. A skull with a slower reload time and higher damage, 
and a ninja star with a fast reload time and low damage.

To move use the ASWD keys. To shoot the skull press the spacebar
To shoot the ninja star use Z key.

Collect items such as health or coins to boost your health and score.

Once all aliens have been cleared from a level you may move onto the next.

On the third stage there is a boss level with a boss fight.

See how high of a score you can get each time.

To play the game download/clone the repo. 
Then run the command for whatever OS you are on and open index.html
